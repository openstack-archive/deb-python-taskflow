Testing and requirements
------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this project has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistence
backends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into two
parts: - things that are absolutely required (you can't use the project
without them) are put into ``requirements.txt``. The requirements
that are required by some optional part of this project (you can use the
project without them) are put into our ``test-requirements.txt`` file (so
that we can still test the optional functionality works as expected). If
you want to use the feature in question (`eventlet`_ or the worker based engine
that uses `kombu`_ or the `sqlalchemy`_ persistence backend or jobboards which
have an implementation built using `kazoo`_ ...), you should add
that requirement(s) to your project or environment.

Tox.ini
~~~~~~~

Our ``tox.ini`` file describes several test environments that allow to test
TaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements installed.
Please refer to the `tox`_ documentation to understand how to make these test
environments work for you.

Developer documentation
-----------------------

We also have sphinx documentation in ``docs/source``.

*To build it, run:*

::

    $ python setup.py build_sphinx
